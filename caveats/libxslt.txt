==> libxslt: Caveats
To allow the nokogiri gem to link against this libxslt run:
  gem install nokogiri -- --with-xslt-dir=/usr/local/opt/libxslt

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/libxslt/include
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib/pkgconfig


If you need Python to find bindings for this keg-only formula, run:
  echo /usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/libxslt.pth
