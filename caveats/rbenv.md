# rbenv

rbenv-1.1.0.sierra.bottle.tar.gz

Rbenv stores data under ~/.rbenv by default. If you absolutely need to
store everything under Homebrew's prefix, include this in your profile:

    export RBENV_ROOT=/usr/local/var/rbenv

To enable shims and autocompletion, run this and follow the instructions:

    rbenv init
