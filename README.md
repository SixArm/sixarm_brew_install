These are our team's "brew install" commands for a typical Mac OSX computer.

Before we begin:

  * Install XCode
  * Install XQuartz: https://xquartz.macosforge.org

To learn what a package does, visit the brew formulas site:

To learn what a specific package does, there's a URL for each package, such as:
