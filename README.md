These are our team's "brew install" commands for a typical Mac OSX computer.

## Contents

Two scripts that install our base pacakages that are suitable for all our users:

  * `brew-install-our-base-packages-automatic.sh`: This script is for all our Mac OSX users; the script is fully automatic i.e. it runs without any passwords, interruptions, blockers, etc.
  * `brew-install-our-base-packages-manual.sh`: This script is for all our Mac OSX users; the script needs passwords to install packages, and other kinds of human intervention and problem solving.

Two scripts that install our tech packages that are suitable for our programmers,:

  * `brew-install-our-tech-packages-automatic.sh`: This script is for all our Mac OSX users; the script is fully automatic i.e. it runs without any passwords, interruptions, blockers, etc.
  * `brew-install-our-tech-packages-manual.sh`: This script is for all our Mac OSX users; the script needs passwords to install packages, and other kinds of human intervention and problem solving.

We like to handle the tech packages in their own files because they tend to be larger downloads, larger packages, and take more time to install.

## Usage

Before you begin:

  * Install XCode
  * Install XQuartz: https://xquartz.macosforge.org

To run the scripts:

  * Option 1: clone the repo, then use your shell to run any of the scripts.
  * Option 2: simply view the raw text of any of the scripts, and copy/paste into your shell.
